# Headphones Landing Page â€“ A Responsive HTML & CSS Project

Welcome to the Headphones Landing Page, a handcrafted, fully responsive webpage built from scratch using HTML and CSS onlyâ€”no frameworks, no shortcuts. This project was built as part of the ALX Front-End Software Engineering program, with an emphasis on building pixel-perfect layouts from designer files.

This README aims to document not only what was built, but also how, why, and what was learned in the process.

## Project Overview

The objective was simple in wordingâ€”but significant in execution:

> Recreate a landing page exactly as designed by UI/UX designer Nicolas Philippot in Figma, using only HTML, CSS, and best practices in responsive design and accessibility.

No JavaScript (until the final step), no CSS frameworks. Just raw code, logic, and an eye for detail.

## What This Project Demonstrates

* Semantic HTML structure with accessibility in mind
* Custom CSS styling, including variables, resets, and responsive techniques
* Mobile-first design with a fluid experience across screen sizes
* Component reusability through clean class naming and structure
* Visual fidelity, paying close attention to designer specs in Figma
* Smooth animations and transitions using only CSS
* Custom icon fonts implementation
* HTML/CSS-based geometry (pentagons) to replace image-based backgrounds
* Progressive enhancement with JavaScript for the hamburger menu

## Project Structure

```
alx_html_css/
â””â”€â”€ headphones/
    â”œâ”€â”€ index.html (laying out the body)
    â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css (or variants per version)
    â”œâ”€â”€ script.js (for hamburger menu)
    â”œâ”€â”€ assets/               # Fonts, images, icons
```

## Key Features

### Pure CSS Layout & Styling

* No external CSS frameworks like Bootstrap
* Mobile breakpoint set at `480px` and under
* Content container max-width: `1000px`, centered
* Hover states for links (`#FF6565`) and buttons (opacity: `0.9`)
* CSS reset included for consistent cross-browser rendering
* Font loading from local or external sources (Source Sans Pro, Spin Cycle OT)

### ðŸ“± Responsiveness

* Adaptive layout that switches seamlessly to a mobile version
* Hero and menu adapt fluidly
* Hamburger navigation appears on small screens and toggles menu using JS

### Custom Geometry

* Pentagon visuals recreated with only HTML and CSS in `6-index.html`
* A good exercise in advanced CSS transforms and creativity

### Animations

* Subtle transitions and hover animations enhance interactivity
* Animations are consistent, non-intrusive, and performance-friendly

---

## Tools & Technologies Used

* Figma (for design reference)
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript (only in the final task)
* Font Awesome-like custom icon fonts
* Git & GitHub for version control

---

## Implementation Notes

### About Figma:

* The designs were recreated from [this shared Figma file](https://www.figma.com/)
* Font files were installed locally to match exact visual styles
* Rounded float values were used when pixel-perfect accuracy wasn't feasible

### Development Process:

> The strategy I followed was building from the outside in and top to bottom, starting with layout containers, then filling in content blocks. This ensured alignment stayed consistent as more sections were added.

I also focused on keeping selectors simple and generic to make code easier to scale and maintain.

## What I Learned

This wasn't just about writing HTML and CSSâ€”it was about discipline in structure, patience in aligning pixels, and resilience when things didnâ€™t look quite right.

Some key takeaways:

* The importance of clean structure before styling
* Why reset CSS is crucial for cross-browser consistency
* How to use custom fonts and icon sets
* The power of reusable components
* How much detail is hidden in designer files, and why Figma is a developer's friend

## Final Thoughts

This project marked the end of the HTML and CSS module in my learning journey, and itâ€™s a strong reminder that foundations matter. Clean code, readable structure, attention to detailâ€”these are the quiet, invisible ingredients behind beautiful interfaces.

If youâ€™re reviewing this repo, I hope it gives you a sense of not just what I can build, but how I think as a developer.

Thanks for reading.
