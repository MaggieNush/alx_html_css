This project involved practising on the CSS basics plus advanced skills on how to style an html page. I began with laying down the structure for the page through html then later proceeded to styling the page to look the same as the figma design provided. It was a great experience having a hands on project that gave me a clear understanding on the basics of both html and css and what it takes bring a website to life from UI designs to coding. It was an amazing project.
